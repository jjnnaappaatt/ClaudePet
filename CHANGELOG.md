# Changelog

All notable changes to ClaudePet are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); versions are dated on release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Reactive weather & celebrations** behind the pet — an ambient pixel sky that follows your usage,
  driven by the same mood signal as the mascot's face: a gentle sun when idle or with headroom,
  drifting clouds at mid-usage, rain as you approach a limit, and a heavy storm with lightning at the
  edge. A fresh 5-hour window triggers a confetti burst; crossing into the danger zone (≥95%)
  triggers a lightning strike (each fires once, on the transition). The sky sits in a taller scene
  above the pet so the two never overlap. Honors Reduce Motion, pauses when occluded / in Low Power,
  and can be turned off via Settings → Appearance → "Weather effects" (on by default).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- The plan badge ("Max 5×") in the wide layout's Today header no longer wraps one character
  per line when space is tight — it stays on a single line like the adjacent labels.

### Changed
- Live statusline data is now treated as **stale after 30 minutes**. If the statusline hasn't
  refreshed its local cache recently, ClaudePet drops the `live` badge and falls back to the
  local estimate instead of presenting an outdated percentage as current. The cache age
  ("2m ago") still shows so you can see why.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-14

First public release.

### Added
- MIT `LICENSE`, an end-user `README` (install + Gatekeeper steps, statusline/live-data setup,
  screenshots), and `release.sh` — builds a drag-install DMG, ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer
  account needed).
- A web mirror of the UI for [claude.ai/design](https://claude.ai/design) under `frontend/`.

### Notes
- Ships the classic widget: Today header (work / cache / cost), live 5-hour + weekly gauges,
  by-model split, a weekly chart, Week & cycle totals, billing, and the ambient pixel mascot.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial build: live Claude-usage widget (5h + weekly gauges, per-model split, weekly chart,
  billing), statusline live-data integration, calibration, and the emotional pixel mascot.
